# My simple fitness application.
<p> This is my first real application deployed to google cloud app engine. I made an earlier version of the app, but it was so bad I couldn't leave it like that. </p>
# Before
![My bad version](workout_og.PNG)
<p> I decided to implement the laravel framework. It's pretty easy to get up and running. By default everything in the application is run from the controller in /public/index.php. I was really impressed with the difference. </p>
# After

<p>Here is the live version of the application: [myfitness](https://myfitness-233014.appspot.com/workouts)</p>
